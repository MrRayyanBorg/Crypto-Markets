# Crypto-Markets
a program that tracks cryptocurrency prices in real-time might be both interesting and practical. This program could fetch the latest prices of various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc., and display them in a user-friendly manner.


API Selection: We'll use a public API like CoinGecko or CryptoCompare to get cryptocurrency prices.

Python Libraries: We'll use requests for making API calls and possibly pandas for data manipulation.

Fetching Data: The script will fetch real-time data from the selected API.

Displaying Data: Display the data in a readable format in the console. This can be later expanded to a GUI or a web application.


Remember, you'll need to install the requests library if you haven't already:

pip install requests





If the Python script runs successfully on your machine, the output would look like a simple text display in the console showing the current prices of the selected cryptocurrencies in USD. Here's an example of what you might see:

Bitcoin: $ 39856.23

Ethereum: $ 2795.42

Litecoin: $ 132.50

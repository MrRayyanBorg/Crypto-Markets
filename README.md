# Crypto-Markets
a program that tracks cryptocurrency prices in real-time might be both interesting and practical. This program could fetch the latest prices of various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc., and display them in a user-friendly manner.


API Selection: We'll use a public API like CoinGecko or CryptoCompare to get cryptocurrency prices.
Python Libraries: We'll use requests for making API calls and possibly pandas for data manipulation.
Fetching Data: The script will fetch real-time data from the selected API.
Displaying Data: Display the data in a readable format in the console. This can be later expanded to a GUI or a web application.
